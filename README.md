# Very-Basic-Chatbot
In July of 2022, I decided that I was going to study computer science, and Python was the first language I was exposed to. This is an example of a very simple python chatbot that I made when I self taught myself Python through a Youtube tutorial. It has some inspiration from Terminator, which I thought was interesting because it's very difficult to get a computer, even an AI one, to behave and learn like a human does. It's quite dangerous since computers are more accurate and have more knowledge than humans. Through this self study journey, I learned that a computer has to listen to what you input. It can't infer on it's own, which is what makes it so intriguing to me. Animals and lower intelligence creatures can infer, but a computer cannot, yet it can calulate and perform tasks that we cannot, which muddles the spectrum of intelligence.
